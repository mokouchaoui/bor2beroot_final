*************Setting Up a Strong Password Policy*******

Add password age

- sudo vi /etc/login.defs after we go to PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999 then PASS_MAX_DAYS   30 then PASS_MIN_DAYS   0 , PASS_MIN_DAYS   2, PASS_WARN_AGE   7

Strong Password

Secondly, to set up policies in relation to password strength, install the libpam-pwquality package.

-sudo apt install libpam-pwquality

Configure password strength policy via

-sudo vi /etc/pam.d/common-password and after we add password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 and To set password minimum length to 10 characters minlen=10, 

To require password to contain at least an uppercase character and a numeric character:

ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 , To set a maximum of 3 consecutive identical characters:

maxrepeat=3
To reject the password if it contains <username> in some form:

reject_username To set the number of changes required in the new password from the old password to 7:

difok=7
To implement the same policy on root:

enforce_for_root 
Finally we need it like this :
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root
